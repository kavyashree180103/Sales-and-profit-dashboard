 Data visualization using tableau

Data set name: Super store sales 

Data extracted from kaggle.com

I have uploaded the excel file format to data source in tableu public

In sheet 1 i have sorted the sales of products based on the region i have used bar graph to represent it and then arranged the bar graphn in descending orderand and i have used filter to sort top 10 region of highest sales 

In sheet 2 i have created a table format data given a business summary of total amount of sales,discount and profit earned , I have used format function to bold the data in panes and headers

In sheet 3 i have created a bar graph visualization to find top 10 highest selling products under a subcategory 

In sheet 4 i hvae created a  line chart for the yearly analysis to find out the highest profit, sales and discount in an year using all these four sheets i have created a dashboard and i have used floating option to rearrange the sheet according to the desktop view

I have used filter option in the data sales by region By using filTers in Sales by region data the other data set get changes according to the region for example when i click california it will show the yearly analysis sales in line chart with total amount of sales ,profit & discount in particular region and top catogry of product sold in california.
